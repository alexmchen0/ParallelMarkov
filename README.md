# Parallel Markov Chain Builder

A random text generator using a parallelized version of Markov chain algorithm implemented [here](https://golang.org/doc/codewalk/markov/).

Explores Go concurrency primitives (goroutines, channels, mutexes, barriers, etc.) to achieve speedup via concurrency and synchronization.
